#### LSE

#### CMLL
* main priority
* should display the cube in 2D and 3D
* should be able to use different algorithms
* should choose white / yellow / custom / random on top
* should choose front color as well (custom)
* should be anki like
    - three buckets
        * unseen    (never seen)
        * unknown   (less than 1 total successfull attempt, min 0)
        * learning  (1-3 successfull attempts)
        * mastered   (more than 3 total successfull attemts, max 3)
    - success count [0, 3] is used to determine bucket
    - unseen count does not really matter, unseens should be chosen when unlearned
    - unknown + learning count should ideally be around 5
    - mastered count does not really matter, mastered shuold be randomly chosen to verify the user knows the algoritm
* should be able to select your preffered algorithm per case
    - multiple seems unessicary, as new algorithms may be learned by choosing new algorithm for case
* should be able to input custom algorithm(s) per case

#### 2-look CMLL

#### First block

#### Second block
